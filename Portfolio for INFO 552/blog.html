              <p> To begin my journey into the Technology Field, I invested countless hours of my time on various platforms. My main one was youtube.
                  Through Youtube, I was able to gain a great insight into many different careers such as Software Development and Cybersecurity.
                  Along with Youtube, Twitter, a social media platform, has also granted me a wealth of knowledge. Through these platforms, I began my transition
                  into this space through learning the fundamentals of Digital Marketing.

                <h3>Digital Marketing</h3>
                <p>So there I was googling away, youtubing away, trying to figure out what would be a field that has a low barrier to entry and that can grant me skills to have a decent lifestyle.
                    As I descended down this rabbit hole, I discovered the field of digital marketing. In my own words, digital marketing is basically marketing through the internet.
                    This form of marketing relies on a company's or individual's digital presence and audience. To reach the masses, entities can use a myraid of tools such as social media, email list, podcast and of course
                    Youtube. Although these are all necessary, companies want to be seen by as many customers as possible. Their aim is to get on the first page of a google search. This is where 
                    SEO and Keywords take center stage. Keywords can be thought of as words commonly used in google searches relating to a specific service or product. SEO is known as Search Engine Optimization and optimizes your online content
                    depending on the keywords that are used.
