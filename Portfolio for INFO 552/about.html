              <p>Before arriving to Drexel, I attended the University of South Florida where I pursued a bachelor's in Biomedical Science. I once had aspirations of becoming a doctor, but as time passed I realized it was not the right path for me. 
                  After graduation I wondered what my next step in life may be. Through trial and error of trying a variety of activities from digital marketing to writing, I realized the Technology industry was right for me.
                A main reason for this was Technology satisfies my intellectual curiosity in the same manner that medicine does. For instance, I would always marvel at something common as a website in the same manner as a pharmaceutical drug.

                Beyond this comparison, however, the thought process behind creating effects in a  that would ultimately define the userâ€™s experience of an entire product always captivated me. 
                As a result of this, I created a few websites through the use of WordPress. Through this, I was not only able to design and create but also, I had the freedom to write and convey powerful messages to my visitors. 
                Now, I have the opportunity to code my first website to not only display my projects, but also my other achievements thus far.
